    * Get Messages between the two users

Architecture:

    API Services
    

WORKFLOW:
    * Load contacts = Its main functionality is to get the contacts(for now, all contacts are being retrieved).
        - When the messaging page loads, this will retreive the contacts from the server.
        - If the response is success, then it will create containers for each contact.
        - The contact div is clickable for each contact.
            - if it is being clicked then it is going to retreive all existing messages with the contact and current user.
                - This will call the server to get the group name for the current user and the contact.
                - It will add a connection group using the response data from group name api.
                    NOTE: If there is already existing connection, it will be removed first then add new one.
                - Finally, all the messages between the current user and the contact will be retrieved.
                - The retreived messages will be displayed.

    * Sending a message = Its functionality is to send message to the target user/contact/recipient.
